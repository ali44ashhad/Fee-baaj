      {/* Part 2: English Additional Terms */}
      <section className="mb-8 space-y-4">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Additional Terms</h2>
        <p>
          The materials and goods are based on concepts from the curriculum, which is outlined for pupils of various classes. The Application/Services/Products should not be seen as a replacement for traditional schooling; instead, they are designed to complement it by providing a way to make complex ideas easier to understand. Everything about the subject would remain the same, except the definitions and equations. Freebaj understands that there are other ways to present structured curriculum pedagogy and that the inclusion of methods in the Application/Services/Products does not mean that Freebaj endorses any of them. The use of our Services/Website/Products does not guarantee entry to any academic institutions or the success of any exam or achieving any designated percentage in any test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contents of the Application/Services/Website/Products (especially those about services which help with administrative tasks) are sometimes opinionated. Such opinions will not be the responsibility of Freebaj. Freebaj also provides no guarantees on the quality, content, or completeness of the information and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Services include interactive content, and we encourage users to submit content for publication. The content is subject to editing prior to publication. No accountability or obligation is accepted by Freebaj for any content communicated via this method. Freebaj maintains the right to remove, review, edit, or delete any content at its sole discretion. We will not be liable for any user-generated content placed on the site, whether or not we have approved any user-submitted answers. It would be irresponsible of us to make sure that the content provided by any User doesn't infringe on anyone's copyright.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freebaj (and its subsidiaries/affiliates) may contact Users through SMS, email, and phone calls to inform them about their services and products and to seek permission to demonstrate their offerings. The User grants permission to Freebaj (and its subsidiaries/affiliates) to contact him/her via telephone, SMS, e-mail, and he/she agrees to hold Freebaj harmless from any liability, including financial penalties, damages, and expenses if the User's mobile number is registered with the Do Not Call (DNC) database. You will be contacted through several means for marketing and educational information once you register, including over the phone, SMS, and email.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freebaj may, at the user's consent, assist in a demonstration of its products at the requested location, but the user understands that they have not been misled by anyone in regard to the products' quality or other features, and that they relied solely on their own investigations, inspections, and evaluations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freebaj may reach you by your registered mobile number, e-mail, or any other contact information you supply to help us better provide our services. The User agrees to receive communications and messages from Freebaj and the student via the Services, and may receive messages via the methods specified in the paragraph above. Freebaj can monitor User/student downloads and use of the Application/Services/Products and contents to talk with the User/student in order to improve and optimize usage of the Services. Students must agree to have their doubts about assignments cleared by the application's service, and the application must respond to any questions that students have about their coursework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even while Freebaj has made an attempt to train its sales and service employees to do quality control, it offers no warranties or assurances about the employees' ability to do so, and is not responsible for any malfeasance committed by any of its employees. Freebaj invites User feedback on this matter, and reserves the right to act as it sees fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elements of the Services including counseling, case management, and so on may be subject to their own terms, conditions, and fair use policy. Freebaj has the authority to set various service aspects' requirements based on its regulations. Because of this, subscriptions to the app or signing up for services does not mean that the user is entitled to all Freebaj provides. It's up to the Freebaj to decide who gets access to particular services. Our Services may be extended, canceled, discontinued, or changed without notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devices/tablets/instruments/hardware with particular specifications are compatible with the Freebaj’s products and/or Services, including the Application and content. Freebaj is not required to deliver operational products and services for any tools that it doesn't accept or that are bought from a third party and that don't work with Freebaj merchandise. Freebaj is free to upgrade the table/device type as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from your use of our products and services, including loss of data or impact on processing speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of purchase, you must specify the address where the shipment should be delivered. All merchandise must be delivered to the address provided upon ordering, and it is prohibited to change the delivery address following purchase completion.

        <p>
          The shipping charges associated with the return of goods damaged at the time of delivery will be paid by the Freebaj. For any reason other than the reasons listed above, the User is responsible for arranging the return of the canceled product(s) and is responsible for the shipping charges. Please do not accept any delivery that appears to have been tampered with, opened, or damaged. Freebaj products must be returned in their original condition. Returns will not be accepted for items that show any wear or damage in any way. All requests for product returns must be made within 15 days of delivery.

To ensure that the account information you give is accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date, remember that you are solely responsible for doing so. You will be in charge of protecting the account information, as well as all activity that takes place on your account.

If we have cause to think that you've had a security breach or misuse of your account, we may ask you to change your password or suspend your account, and you may do so without incurring any liability to the Freebaj. Freebaj will not be responsible for any losses or damages you could incur due to your failure to comply with this section.

      <section className="space-y-4">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">রিফান্ড কী?</h3>
        <p>
          যখন কোনও শিক্ষার্থী অ্যাপ/ওয়েবসাইটে কারিগরি সমস্যার কারণে কোর্সটি অ্যাক্সেস করতে অক্ষম হন, অথবা কোর্সে প্রতিশ্রুতি অনুযায়ী রিসোর্স না পান অথবা ভুল করে Freebaj অন্য কোনও কোর্সের পরিবর্তে কোনও কোর্স কিনে ফেলেন, তখন ব্যবহারকারী রিফান্ডের জন্য অনুরোধ করতে পারেন যা যাচাইকরণ প্রক্রিয়ার মধ্য দিয়ে যেতে হবে।
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">রিফান্ডের জন্য কীভাবে অনুরোধ করবেন?</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>যদি আপনি কোনও পৃথক কোর্স বা বান্ডেল কোর্সের জন্য অর্থ প্রদান করে থাকেন, তাহলে আপনি আপনার অর্থ প্রদানের 30 দিনের মধ্যে রিফান্ডের জন্য অনুরোধ করতে পারেন।</li>
          <li>রিফান্ডের জন্য অনুরোধ করতে, কম্পিউটারে এই পদক্ষেপগুলি অনুসরণ করুন:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>support@freebaj.net-এ আমাদের ইমেল করুন এবং সাইন আপ করার জন্য এবং কোর্সটি কেনার জন্য আপনি যে ইমেল ঠিকানা/ফোন নম্বরটি ব্যবহার করেছেন তা উল্লেখ করুন।</li>
              <li>একজন গ্রাহক সহায়তা প্রতিনিধি রিফান্ডের অনুরোধটি আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে জমা দেওয়ার জন্য একটি ফর্ম এসএমএস/ইমেল করবেন যেখানে আপনাকে ক্রয় সম্পর্কিত বিশদ জমা দিতে বলা হবে।</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>রিফান্ডের অনুরোধগুলি কেবল তখনই বৈধ বলে বিবেচিত হবে যদি ক্রয়ের ৩০ দিনের মধ্যে support@freebaj.net-এ ইমেল করে যোগাযোগ করা হয় এবং নিবন্ধনের সময় ব্যবহৃত আপনার ইমেল ঠিকানা বা ফোন নম্বর স্পষ্টভাবে উল্লেখ করা হয়।</li>
          <li>রিফান্ড ই-বুকের ক্ষেত্রে প্রযোজ্য নয়। যদি আপনি নির্দিষ্ট কোর্সের জন্য তিন বা ততোধিক ক্লাসে অংশগ্রহণ করার পরেও রিফান্ডের অনুরোধ জমা দেন, তাহলে যেকোনো বা সকল কোর্সের জন্য রিফান্ড প্রযোজ্য হবে না। যদি আপনি একটি পেইড কোর্সের জন্য তিন বা তার কম ক্লাসে অংশগ্রহণ না করে থাকেন, তাহলে আপনি রিফান্ড চাইতে পারেন। Freebaj আপনাকে নির্দিষ্ট কোর্সের জন্য আপনি যে পরিমাণ অর্থ প্রদান করেছেন তার সঠিক পরিমাণ রিফান্ড করবে।</li>
          <li>গ্রাহক যে মাধ্যমে অর্থ প্রদান করেছেন সেই মাধ্যমে অথবা ভাউচার আকারে Freebaj কর্তৃক রিফান্ডের অনুরোধ সফলভাবে প্রক্রিয়াকরণ এবং অনুমোদনের ৭-১৪ কার্যদিবসের মধ্যে রিফান্ড করা হবে। এই নিশ্চিতকরণ ব্যবহারকারীকে ইমেল অথবা এস এম এস করা হবে।</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">কখন রিফান্ড প্রযোজ্য হবে না?</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>যদি আপনি ক্রয়ের তারিখ থেকে ৩০ দিন পরে অভিযোগ বা রিফান্ডের অনুরোধ জমা দিয়ে থাকেন।</li>
          <li>যদি আপনি ৩০ দিনের অভিযোগ সময়ের মধ্যে অভিযোগ দায়ের করেন এবং পরবর্তী ৭ দিনের রিফান্ড সময়ের মধ্যে মোট তিনটির বেশি ক্লাসে যোগদান চালিয়ে যান, তাহলে আপনি রিফান্ড পাওয়ার অধিকারী হবেন না।</li>
          <li>যখন আপনি রিফান্ডের অনুরোধ করেন, তখন রিফান্ড প্রক্রিয়া চলমান থাকবে। অতএব, যদি আপনি কোনও কার্যকলাপ (একটি ভিডিও চালান, একটি কুইজ বা পরীক্ষা চেষ্টা করুন, নির্দিষ্ট কোর্সের উপকরণ ডাউনলোড করুন) সম্পন্ন করেন এবং কোর্সটি চালিয়ে যান, তাহলে আপনি রিফান্ড অনুরোধের জন্য যোগ্য হবেন না।</li>
          <li>যদি আপনি রিফান্ডের অনুরোধ করার আগে 3 টিরও বেশি প্রিমিয়াম/পেইড ভিডিও/লাইভ ভিডিও সম্পন্ন করেন, তাহলে আপনি রিফান্ডের জন্য যোগ্য হবেন না।</li>
          <li>যদি আপনি একটি ই-বুক কিনে থাকেন।</li>
          <li>যদি আপনি একটি সাবস্ক্রিপশন ভিত্তিক কোর্স কিনে থাকেন এবং সেই কোর্সের ৩ টির বেশি ক্লাস সফলভাবে সম্পন্ন করেন।</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">রিফান্ড কখন প্রযোজ্য হবে?</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>যদি কোনও ভুল ক্রয়ের ক্ষেত্রে বা গ্রাহক অন্য কোর্স কিনতে ইচ্ছুক হন, তাহলে সঠিক যাচাইকরণ এবং আপনার অনন্য ব্যবহারকারী আইডি ব্যবহার করে অন্য কোর্সে স্থানান্তর করা যেতে পারে। যদি নতুন কোর্সের মূল্য ক্রয়কৃত কোর্সের চেয়ে বেশি, ব্যবহারকারীকে পছন্দের পেমেন্ট পদ্ধতিতে Freebaj অতিরিক্ত অর্থ প্রদান করতে হবে। কম হলে, অতিরিক্ত অর্থ ফেরত পাবেন।</li>
          <li>যদি Freebaj কোর্সে প্রতিশ্রুতি অনুযায়ী রিসোর্স সরবরাহ করতে ব্যর্থ হয়।</li>
          <li>ভুল করে রেকর্ড করা ক্লাসের পরিবর্তে লাইভ ক্লাস কিনে ফেলেছে এবং বিপরীতভাবে।</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">যখন আপনি টাকা ফেরতের অনুরোধ করেন, তখন কী হবে?</h3>
        <p>
          একবার টাকা ফেরতের অনুরোধ জমা দেওয়া হলে, আপনার নথিভুক্ত কোর্সটি লক হয়ে যাবে। টাকা ফেরতের অনুরোধ গ্রহণ করা হলে, অনুরোধ পাওয়ার ৩ কার্যদিবসের মধ্যে Freebaj আপনাকে এসএমএস বা ইমেইলের মাধ্যমে জানাবে। টাকা ফেরতের অনুরোধ গ্রহণের পর, আপনাকে কোর্স থেকে নাম বাতিল করা হবে এবং আপনার অগ্রগতি বাতিল করা হবে। আপনি যদি আবার কোর্সটি কিনতে চান, তাহলে আপনাকে শুরু থেকেই কোর্সটি শুরু করতে হবে। প্রার্থিত টাকা ফেরতের পরে আপনার অ্যাকাউন্টে অর্থ ফেরত আসতে ৭-১৪ কার্যদিবস পর্যন্ত সময় লাগতে পারে। যদি ১৪ কার্যদিবসের বেশি সময় লেগে থাকে, তাহলে অনুগ্রহ করে support@freebaj.net এ ইমেইল করুন। টাকা ফেরত হয়ে গেলে, আপনি আপনার নিবন্ধিত ইমেইল/ফোন নম্বরে একটি নিশ্চিতকরণ ইমেইল/এসএমএস পাবেন।
